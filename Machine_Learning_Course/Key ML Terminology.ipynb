    "Label - The THING we are predicting (y in simple linear reg), e.g future price of coffee beans, kind of animal shown in a picture\n",
    "Feature - Input variable (x in simple linear reg). Simple ML project might use one feature, more complex might use millions of features.\n",

    "E.g in a spam detector for email:\n",
    "Features - keywords, sender, time of day email was sent\n",

    "Examples - particular instance of data. Can be either labeled or unlabeled.\n",
    "Labeled Example - includes features and label {features, label}; {x, y}\n",
    "These are used to train the model\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlabeled examples - includes features but not the label {features, ?}; {x, ?}\n",

    "Once a model is trained with labeled examples, we used it to predict the labels for unlabeled examples.\n",

    "Regression - predicts continuous values e.g house price in california\n",
    "Classification - predicts discrete values e.g is an email spam or not spam?"
