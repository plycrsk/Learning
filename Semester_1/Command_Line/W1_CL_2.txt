For file:
r = File opened and read
w = File written and truncated. Can not rename or delete
x = Treated as program and executed
For Directory:
r = contents can be listed if x also set
w = Files within can be created, deleted and renamed
x = Allows a directory to be entered e.g. cd Desktop

chmod allows user to modify permissions
7 (rwx)
6 (rw-)
5 (r-x)
4 (r--)
0 (---)

e.g chmod 755 will set file to RWXR-XR-X, readable, writeable, executable for user, readable and executable (but not writeable) for group and world.

Can also change permissions using symbol system
u = user
g = group
o = 'others' i.e. world
a = u, g and o

u+x = adds executable to user
o-rw = removes read and write from world
etc...
